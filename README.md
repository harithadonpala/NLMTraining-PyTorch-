# NLMTraining-PyTorch-
In this project, I build a neural language model from scratch using PyTorch, train it on the given dataset, and analyze its performance using loss curves and perplexity. I compare underfitting, overfitting, and well-fit models to understand how architecture and capacity affect learning.
